# Tourist landing page

### Tech stack: HTML | CSS | JS

#### I created this website during one of the selection stages for the "Unilab" internship.

"Tourism" is a dynamic website. Users of this site can get information about tours in different countries, learn more about the company itself, find recommendations, prices, offers, contact details and more. The website has two pages, a landing page and an api page. Data is dynamically generated on both of them, from the local JavaScript objects on the main page and from the faker.api on the api page. Figma template is used for the design. Website is fully responsive.

#### Project Structure:

The project includes : 1. Assets folder in which the images are further divided into folders according to the sections of the site. 2. CSS folder which contains the styles files for the main page, api page and the shared styles. 3.HTML folder which contains api page. 4. JS folder which containes all the script files. 5.Index.html.

#### Landing Page:

On the landing page, there are many sections: hot services, video advert, company achievements, popular tour Packages, subscription and discounts, recommendations, tour booking, popular destinations and contact info. Users can access dynamically generated data about company services.

#### Api Page:

Api page uses nature category images api. We can see 16 random image cards. (This page was part of the task where we had to output dynamic information from Faker.api.)
